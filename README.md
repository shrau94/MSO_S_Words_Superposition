# MSO, S_Words and Superposition

The repositiory is for the implementation of the Dissertation on "MSO, S_Words and Superposition" completed as Presented to the University of Dublin, Trinity College in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science (Intelligent Systems), under the supervision of Tim Fernando.

### Requirements and Installations

The implementations are done in Python notebook with the python version 3.7.4. All the dependent libraries are given below:

1. Install Python v3.7.4 or above.

2. Install the TkInter library v8.5 or above using the below command.

    `pip install tkinter`

2. Install Jupyter Lab for the execution of the codes.

### Executing the codes

Run the files in Jupyter Lab or any other editor for ipynb files.

### Details of the programs

1. `zebra_puzzle_simulation.ipynb` 

    This program utilizes the superposition theorem to solve the Zebra Puzzle problem (a Constraint Satisfaction Problem). It also provides a GUI and simulation of     all the steps and illustrates the MSO formulas used.
    
2. `allen_relations_transitivity_superposition.ipynb`

    This file provides the implementation for obtaining the transitivity between two Allen relations using superposition theorem.
    
3. `interractive_transitivity_grid.ipynb`

    The interactive transitivity grid for Allen relations is provided along with the Rank 0, Rank 1 and Rank 2 relations.

4. `six_train_problem.ipynb`

    Another CSP with temporal constraints - The Six Train Problem is also solved using superposition and the results are compared with the results obtained by Join     operations in S-words.
